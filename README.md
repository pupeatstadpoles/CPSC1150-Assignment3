# CPSC1150-Assignment3
Using program constructs - sequential, selection and repetition


I created two programs. The first asks the user to input an integer from 1-9. Based on the number, a different triangle would be displayed.
Example: user inputs 4


`   1`

`  21`

` 321`

`4321`

The second asks the user to input a positive integer from 1 - 200 (inclusive of both). The program then displays all perfect squares within the range of 0 to the inputted number.
Example: user inputs 37, the program then outputs `0  1  4  9  16  25  36`. 

Input validation: error messages generated by program if the user inputs an integer outside the accetable ranges, and program keeps prompting until valid input is given.
